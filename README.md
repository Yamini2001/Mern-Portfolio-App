# MERN Portfolio App

This is a portfolio application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It showcases my projects and skills in a responsive web application format.

## Features

- **Portfolio Showcase:** Display projects with descriptions and links.
- **Skill Highlight:** Showcase skills and technologies used.
- **Contact Form:** Allow visitors to get in touch via a contact form.

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB: Database to store project and contact information.
- Express.js: Backend framework for API development.
- React: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- Node.js: Runtime environment for server-side application.

## Responsive Design

The application is designed with responsiveness in mind, ensuring it looks good and functions well across various devices including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

### Key Considerations

- **Responsive Framework:** Utilized Bootstrap to create a fluid and responsive layout.
- **Viewport Meta Tag:** Included `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` to ensure proper scaling on mobile devices.
- **Media Queries:** Implemented custom media queries to adjust layout and styles based on screen size.
  
### Testing

The responsiveness of the application was tested extensively using:
- Google Chrome Developer Tools
- Firefox Responsive Design Mode
- Physical devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile)
